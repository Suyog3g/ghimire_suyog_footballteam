                established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when 
                Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined eleven League 
                titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the 
                management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a nineteenth 
                League title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.
